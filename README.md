# Meme Generator

This was a project made while learning react at the 3ยบ [scrimba Learn React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

In this Course we learned how to conditional rendenring, control forms and consume API's in React.

The site is online on my [github pages](https://samuellucas21504.github.io/scrimba-meme-generator/).
